Problem:
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums.

Return the maximum value over all triplets of indices (i, j, k) such that i < j < k. If all such triplets have a negative value, return 0.

The value of a triplet of indices (i, j, k) is equal to (nums[i] - nums[j]) * nums[k].

Example:
Input: nums = [12,6,1,2,7]  Output: 77
Explanation: The value of the triplet (0, 2, 4) is (nums[0] - nums[2]) * nums[4] = 77.
It can be shown that there are no ordered triplets of indices with a value greater than 77.
