You're playing Battleship on a grid of cells with 
R rows and C columns. There are  or more battleships on the grid, each occupying a single distinct cell. The cell in the ith row from the top and 
jth column from the left either contains a battleship (G(i,j)​=1) or doesn't  (G(i,j)​=0)
You're going to fire a single shot at a random cell in the grid. You'll choose this cell uniformly at random from the R∗C possible cells. You're interested in the probability that the cell hit by your shot contains a battleship.
Your task is to implement the function getHitProbability(R, C, G) which returns this probability.
Note: Your return value must have an absolute or relative error of at most 
 10 to the power -6 to be considered correct.
 
 CONSTRAINTS
 1 ≤ R, C ≤ 100, 0≤G (i,j) ≤1

EXAMPLE1; 
R = 2
C = 3
G = 0 0 1
    1 0 1    Expected Return Value = 0.50000000
    
EXAMPLE2; 
R = 2
C = 2
G = 1  1
    1  1    Expected Return Value = 1.00000000
